* My Name is Yared Yilma Dessalegn
* Ethiopian Residing in Gent, Belgium
* Ethiopian Tourism professional.
* written over few dozen of writtings on Ethiopia. 

It's been almost **three years** since I started leaving here in Belgium. By training I am a tourism professional especializing on my country Ethiopia. As a tour operator and a travel consultant on Ethiopian tourism I have always been keen on the importance of the web. Thanks to HYF, I have the chance to study the knowledge and the skills to be a developer. The main thing that I count on when joining HYF is my obsession and gut on staying persistent for the paths that I choose to follow. I feel so compelled to learn the languages of programing like a child and build a foundation to an exciting future. Am hopeful that my motivation to keep me going.

I am here to make it and more!
